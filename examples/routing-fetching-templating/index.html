        <p>In general, use the Network panel when you need to make sure that resources are being downloaded or uploaded as expected. The most common use cases for the Network panel are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Making sure that resources are actually being uploaded or downloaded at all.</li>
          <li>Inspecting the properties of an individual resource, such as its HTTP headers, content, size, and so on.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you're looking for ways to improve page load performance, don't start with the Network panel. There are many types of load performance issues that aren't related to network activity. Start with the Audits panel because it gives you targeted suggestions on how to improve your page.</p>

      <section data-route="console">
        <h2>Console</h2>
        <p>Web developers often log messages to the Console to make sure that their JavaScript is working as expected. To log a message, you insert an expression like console.log('Hello, Console!') into your JavaScript. When the browser executes your JavaScript and sees an expression like that, it knows that it's supposed to log the message to the Console. </p>

      <section data-route="debugger">
        <h2>Debugger</h2>
        <p>The console.log() method may get the job done, but breakpoints can get it done faster. A breakpoint lets you pause your code in the middle of its execution, and examine all values at that moment in time. </p>
